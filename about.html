        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>The mission of the Early College Studies (ECS) program at Stamford High School is to support students in cultivating future-ready skills for high school, college and the workforce while empowering them to pursue a career in computer science.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a partnership with CT State Norwalk (formerly Norwalk Community College), students have the opportunity to simultaneously earn their high school diploma and an associate’s degree in computer science within four, five or six years. Stamford High School educators provide students with the coursework they need to develop appropriate academic and executive skills while content-specific educators at CT State Norwalk provide coursework students need for the degree in Computer Science.</p>
